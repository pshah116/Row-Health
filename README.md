## Project Overview

# The goal of this project is to investigate the performance of marketing campaigns at Row Health to surface recommendations on marketing budget allocation across future campaign categories

Founded in 2016, Row Health is a U.S.-based medical insurance provider serving thousands of customers. In 2019, they launched marketing campaigns centered on wellness education, affordability, and preventative care, supporting four plan tiers—bronze, silver, gold, and platinum—with varying premiums and coverage.

With a new data team in place and a renewed focus on strategic marketing, Row Health is looking to evaluate the effectiveness of its campaign categories. The primary goals are to boost customer signups and strengthen national brand awareness
